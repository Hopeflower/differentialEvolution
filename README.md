# differentialEvolution

An implementation of the famous Differential Evolution Computational Intelligence algorithm formulated by Storn and Price. This algorithm uses the Otsu criterion as the fitness function and can be used to threshold grayscale images using multiple thresholds. The solution you get is near-optimal, just as every computational intelligence algorithm is meant to work.

An (unsuccessful) attempt is also made to optimize the algorithm using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The PSO algorithm could be ignored for now.
